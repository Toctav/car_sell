# car_sell
This project implements a Machine Learning solution to estimate the resale value of used vehicles. Using a dataset of over 7,400 real-world transactions, we developed a predictive model to determine fair market prices based on vehicle specifications and market attributes.

## Key Features
End-to-End Workflow: From raw data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to feature engineering and model deployment.

Robust Preprocessing: Handled missing values, removed multicollinearity, and engineered features like vehicle age and depreciation metrics.

Model Performance: The Random Forest Regressor baseline achieved an R² Score of ~0.90 and a MAPE of 11.6%, providing reliable price estimates with strong generalization on unseen data.

Insight Generation: Identified Body Type, Manufacturing Year, and Car Age as the top three drivers of used car valuation.

## Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
